    title: "1️⃣ Setting Up Your Stream Like a Pro",
    text: "Before you go live, configure your software (OBS, Streamlabs, or Twitch Studio) to match your PC specs. Set your output resolution to 720p or 1080p, and use a bitrate between 3500–6000 Kbps for smoother video without lag.",
  },
  {
    title: "2️⃣ Optimize Your Audio",
    text: "Good visuals don’t matter if your mic sounds bad. Use a pop filter, lower background noise with noise suppression filters, and monitor your voice levels to stay clear and balanced. Viewers stay for good sound more than anything.",
  },
  {
    title: "3️⃣ Design Eye-Catching Overlays",
    text: "Create a clean, branded overlay that includes your webcam frame, recent followers, and chat box. Keep it minimal — clutter distracts. Use sites like OWN3D or StreamElements to find free overlay templates.",
  },
  {
    title: "4️⃣ Engage With Viewers",
    text: "Talk to your viewers! Even if there are only a few, make conversation, answer questions, and thank them by name. Engagement builds community — the key to long-term streaming success.",
  },
  {
    title: "5️⃣ Test Everything Before Going Live",
    text: "Do a private test stream to check your audio sync, webcam, and bitrate stability. This avoids awkward technical issues mid-stream and ensures a smooth experience for your audience.",
