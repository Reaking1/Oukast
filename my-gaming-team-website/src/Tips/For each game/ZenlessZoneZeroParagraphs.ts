    title: "2️⃣ Exploit Enemy Weaknesses",
    text: "Every Hollow has specific elemental or weapon vulnerabilities. Build a balanced team covering Physical, Electric, and Fire types to maximize damage output.",

    title: "3️⃣ Manage Your Energy Wisely",
    text: "Don’t spam skills blindly — maintain a rhythm. Use normal attacks to recover energy and unleash EX skills only when they guarantee a stun or combo finish.",

    title: "4️⃣ Perfect Dodge = Counter Opportunity",
    text: "Timing is everything. A perfectly timed dodge triggers a counter window and slows time for precise follow-up attacks. Practice this against mini-bosses to master it.",

    text: "Your Bangboo companion adds valuable support in combat. Invest in its modules and passive abilities early to gain a consistent edge in harder Hollows.",
